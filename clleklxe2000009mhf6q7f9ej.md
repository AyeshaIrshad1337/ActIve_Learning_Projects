Sorting algorithms play a vital role in data organization and analysis. Among these algorithms, Radix Sort stands out for its unique approach of sorting numbers digit by digit. In this blog, we'll delve into the intricacies of Radix Sort, explore its mechanics, analyze its time complexity, and provide Python code examples to showcase its efficiency in action.

# Radix Sort: Sorting Digit by Digit

Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that processes individual digits of numbers to sort them. It works by repeatedly sorting the input based on each digit's value, from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

## Understanding Radix Sort:

1. Divide the input numbers into buckets based on the least significant digit.
    
2. Sort the numbers within each bucket.
    
3. Repeat the process for each subsequent digit, moving from least to most significant.
    

# Python Implementation of Radix Sort

## Let's explore the Python implementation of Radix Sort:

```python
def counting_sort(arr, exp):
    n = len(arr)
    output = [0] * n
    count = [0] * 10

    for i in range(n):
        index = arr[i] // exp
        count[index % 10] += 1

    for i in range(1, 10):
        count[i] += count[i - 1]

    i = n - 1
    while i >= 0:
        index = arr[i] // exp
        output[count[index % 10] - 1] = arr[i]
        count[index % 10] -= 1
        i -= 1

    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = output[i]

def radix_sort(arr):
    max_val = max(arr)
    exp = 1
    while max_val // exp > 0:
        counting_sort(arr, exp)
        exp *= 10
```

## Time Complexity Analysis

Radix Sort's time complexity is [O(n \* k)](https://ayeshairshad.hashnode.dev/understanding-big-o-notation-analyzing-algorithm-efficiency-in-on), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of digits in the maximum element. It can be particularly efficient for sorting numbers with a limited range of digits. As k is constant so we will take it as [O(n)](https://ayeshairshad.hashnode.dev/understanding-big-o-notation-analyzing-algorithm-efficiency-in-on).

# Conclusion
