So, dive into the world of Python programming for data science and unleash your analytical prowess! Happy coding! üêçüî¨

# Fun Fact:

Python got its name not from the snake, but from the popular British comedy television show "Monty Python's Flying Circus." The language's creator, Guido van Rossum, was a big fan of the show, and when he was developing Python in the late 1980s, he chose the name as a tribute to the comedy group. As a result, Python's official mascot is a snake named "Monty." The unique and humorous origin of Python's name adds a touch of fun and playfulness to the language, making it even more beloved among developers worldwide. üêçüéâ
