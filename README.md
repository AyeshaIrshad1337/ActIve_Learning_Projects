# **Active Learning for Predictive Models**
This repository contains implementations of active learning for various predictive models. The aim is to improve the accuracy of the models by actively selecting the most uncertain samples and adding them to the training data. The following projects are included:

Car Price Prediction
Gold Price Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction
Credit Card Fraud Detection
Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
Big Mart Sale Prediction
Parkinsons Disease Detection
Titanic Survival Prediction
Calories Burn Prediction
Breast Cancer
T20 World Cup Cricket Score Predictor
Laptop Price Predictor
Bengaluru Price Prediction
# **Algorithm**
The algorithm used in these projects is active learning, where the model is updated by adding the most uncertain samples identified by a random forest model. The algorithm is implemented for various predictive models, including linear regression, decision trees, and others.

# **Result**
The result of the active learning process shows that the accuracy of the models improves after each iteration as the most uncertain samples are added to the training data.

# **Usage**
To run these projects, you will need to install the following packages:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You will also need to provide the data files for each project in the same directory as the code.

# **Conclusion**
This repository demonstrates the effectiveness of active learning in improving the accuracy of various predictive models. By actively selecting the most uncertain samples and adding them to the training data, the models can continuously improve their accuracy.
